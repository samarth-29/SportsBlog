# SportsBlog
It is gonna be sports blog with full CRUD functionality blog

Here I have used mongoose which is going to be a different way to communicate with MongoDB. It is more advanced than standard mongoodb      driver.

1) npm init.  This command create package.json file.
2) add dependencies in package.json file:
    "dependencies": {
    "body-parser": "*",
    "express": "*",
    "mongoose": "*",
    "pug": "*",
    "connect-flash": "*",
    "express-messages": "*",
    "express-session": "*",
    "express-validator": "*",
    "moment": "*"
  }
 
 3) run npm install
 4) npm install pug@2.0.0-beta --save
 5) install bootstrap in public folder byt typing this command: bower install bootstrap
